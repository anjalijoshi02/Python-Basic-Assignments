    "- An __iterator__ is an object that contains countable number of values and it is used to ietrable objects like lists, tuples, etc. .For an iterator: iter() keyword is used to create an iterator containing an iterable object.    \n",

    "- Map is faster in case of calling an already defined function on a set of values.\n",
    "- List comprehension allows filtering while there is no such function in map.\n",
